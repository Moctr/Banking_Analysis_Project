#### Overview
The Banking Analysis project aims to assess various aspects of a bank’s performance, focusing on liquidity, profitability, and credit risk. By analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) and conducting customer segmentation using RFM analysis, we gain valuable insights into the bank’s operations.

Objectives
Liquidity Measurement: We evaluate the bank’s liquidity position by examining its ability to meet short-term financial obligations. Liquidity is crucial for smooth operations and risk management.
Profitability Assessment: We analyze the bank’s profitability metrics, such as net income, return on assets (ROA), and return on equity (ROE). These indicators help us understand the bank’s financial health.
Credit Risk Evaluation: We assess the bank’s exposure to credit risk. This involves analyzing loan portfolios, default rates, and provisioning for potential losses.
RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation: Using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis, we segment the bank’s customer base. This technique helps identify high-value customers, understand their behavior, and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
Key Findings
After conducting our analysis, we made the following observations:

Liquidity Concerns: The bank faces liquidity challenges. It relies heavily on customer deposits to fund loans, which can lead to a lack of available cash. Any significant withdrawal by customers could exacerbate this issue.
Credit Risk: The bank’s lending practices may be risky. Providing more loans than the available deposits can support could result in potential losses if borrowers default.
Fake Revenue Generation: The bank’s reported revenue may be inflated due to inadequate liquidity. Generating revenue from loans without sufficient backing can create a misleading financial picture.
Recommendations
Based on our findings, we recommend the following actions:

Liquidity Management: The bank should actively manage its liquidity position. Diversifying funding sources, maintaining adequate reserves, and monitoring withdrawal patterns are essential.
Risk Mitigation: Implement robust credit risk management practices. Assess borrowers thoroughly, set appropriate risk limits, and ensure provisioning for potential loan losses.
Transparency: The bank should transparently communicate its financial health to stakeholders. Avoiding misleading revenue reporting is crucial.
